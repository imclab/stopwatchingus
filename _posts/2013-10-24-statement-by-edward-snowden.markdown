excerpt: A statement by Edward Snowden in support of the Stop Watching Us Rally Against Mass Surveillance
---

Edward Snowden just released this statement in support of the Rally Against Mass Surveillance happening this Saturday in Washington, D.C.:

> In the last four months, we've learned a lot about our government.

> We've learned that the U.S. intelligence community secretly built a system of pervasive surveillance. Today, no telephone in America makes a call without leaving a record with the NSA. Today, no internet transaction enters or leaves America without passing through the NSA's hands. Our representatives in Congress tell us this is not surveillance. They're wrong.

> Now it's time for the government to learn from us. On Saturday, the ACLU, EFF, and the rest of the StopWatching.Us coalition are going to D.C. Join us in sending the message: Stop Watching Us.
