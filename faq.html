### Why rally? 
Right now the NSA is spying on everyone's personal communications, and it’s operating without any meaningful oversight. Since the Snowden leaks started, more than 569,000 people from all walks of life have signed [the StopWatching.us petition](https://option.stopwatching.us) telling the U.S. Congress that we want it to the NSA accountable and to reform the laws that got us here.
 
On October 26th, the 12th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Patriot Act, we're taking the next step and holding the largest rally yet against NSA surveillance. We’ll be handing the half-million petitions to members of Congress to remind them that they work for us — and we won’t tolerate mass surveillance any longer.
 
### Who’s rallying? 
We expect thousands of people from across the political spectrum will attend the rally. We will draw attendees primarily from the DC metro area and locations within approximately 8 hours from DC.

Attendees will join members of the StopWatching.us coalition, which includes more than 100 public advocacy organizations and companies from across the political spectrum. We came together in June 2013 to demand the U.S. Congress investigate the full extent of the NSA's spying programs. [Go here](https://optin.stopwatching.us) to read our letter to U.S. Congress demanding accountability and reform.
 
Members of the StopWatching.us coalition include the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Free Press, Freedom Works, ACLU, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Restore the Fourth, Center for Democracy and Technology, Demand Progress, Mozilla, Public Knowledge, Fight for the Future, Access, Libertarian Party, the Bill of Rights Defense Committee and more. [See the full list](https://rally.stopwatching.us/organizations.html).
 
### What’s the point of the rally? 
We want the U.S. Congress to rein in the NSA. Specifically, we call on Congress to immediately and publicly:
<ol><li>Enact reform this Congress to Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, the state secrets privilege, and the FISA Amendments Act to make clear that blanket surveillance of the Internet activity and phone records of any person residing in the U.S. is prohibited by law and that violations can be reviewed in adversarial proceedings before a public court;</li>
<li>Create a special committee to investigate, report, and reveal to the public the extent of this domestic spying.</li>
<li>This committee should create specific recommendations for legal and regulatory reform to end unconstitutional surveillance;</li>
<li>Hold accountable those public officials who are found to be responsible for this unconstitutional surveillance.</li></ol>
