title: A Rally Against Mass Surveillance

<div class="abouttherally">
  <h2>About the rally</h2>
  <p>Right now the NSA is spying on everyone's personal communications, and they’re operating without any meaningful oversight. Since the Snowden leaks started, <strong>more than 571,000 people from all walks of life have signed the <a href="https://optin.stopwatching.us" target="_blank">StopWatching.us petition</a></strong> telling the U.S. Congress that we want them to rein in the NSA. </p>

  <p>On October 26th, the 12th anniversary of the signing of the US Patriot Act, <strong>we're taking the next step and holding the largest rally yet</strong> against NSA surveillance. <strong>We’ll be handing the half-million petitions to Congress</strong> to remind them that they work for us -- and we won’t tolerate mass surveillance any longer.</p>

  <p>StopWatching.us is a coalition of more than 100 public advocacy organizations and companies from across the political spectrum. We came together in June 2013 to demand the U.S. Congress investigate the full extent of the NSA's spying programs. Go <a href="https://optin.stopwatching.us" target="_blank">here</a> to read our letter to U.S. Congress demanding accountability and reform. </p>
